<p class="title" align="left">Background and Target
<p class="text" align="left"> Delphi/C++Builder/BDS/Rad Studio is famed for its completely 
  open VCL framework: by using third party's codes and components, software 
  developers can improve their productivity enormously. However, among all the 
  third party components, the number of those written by Chinese developers (leave 
  out commercial products) can be counted on the fingers of one hand, let alone 
  those that are comparable to JCL, RxLib, GExperts. 
<p class="text">CnPack is aimed to be an excellent large package at the very outset with many 
  people's contribution. It is also intended to provide a great number of codes 
  and documents for Delphi developers' reference and study.</p>

<p class="title" align="left"> Distribution and License
<p class="text">CnPack is an open source project. You can use and copy it freely 
  for non-commercial purposes.</p>

<p class="title" align="left">About CnPack Team
<p class="text" align="left">CnPack is developed completely by a virtual team 
  over Internet. The team is composed of a group of Chinese fans of Delphi/C++Builder, 
  who volunteer to join together to build an truly excellent third party free 
  package. CnPack becomes Embarcadero Technology Partner(ETP) in 2009.

  They are divided into package design group, implementation group, assistant 
  group and website maintenance group, with different responsibilities shared by 
  each group.</p>

  work, but also more importantly build the best open source developer team in 
  China via the development practice.</p>
